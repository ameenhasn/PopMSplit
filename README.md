PopMSplit
=========

PopMSplit allows it's user to "split" a movie (avi, flv, m4v, mkv, mov, mp4, ogg) into multiple different segments. Along with splitting the movie up, it can also be used to extract segments of audio and/or video from a movie file, and to convert containers. PopMSplit uses ffmpeg -vcodec copy option to split your movies as quickly as you can copy them with 0 loss to quality. NO MORE RE-ENCODING!!! But, if you want, or need to re-encode, then go ahead and do so, PopMSplit can do that too.
